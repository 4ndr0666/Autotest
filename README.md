# Shell Script Testing Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a shell script and an automated testing setup using GitHub Actions. The purpose is to ensure that any changes to the script maintain its functionality and integrity.

## Testing Workflow
The `.github/workflows/shell_unit_test.yml` file defines a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tests the shell script upon every push to the repository.

### How It Works
- On every push, GitHub Actions triggers the workflow.
- The workflow runs unit tests on the shell script using the `gen-sh-unittest` action.
- Test results are outputted for review.
- If there are changes (like test reports), the workflow commits and pushes these back to the repository.

## Running the Tests Locally
To run the tests on your local machine, [describe how to run the tests locally, including any dependencies or setup required].

## Contributing
